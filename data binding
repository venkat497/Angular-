Data Binding:- 

Binding the data from the component to template or template to component.
--Interacting with data.

Data should get updated in HTML is based on our logic by functionality in the typescript.

2 types of data binding:-

a) One way data binding 

--Data can only tranferred from component to view/html/template.

b) Two way data binding 

--Component to HTML 
--HTML to component

a)one way data binding:- 

There 4 types--

1.interpolation/ String interpolation:--

  {{property_name}}

2.Property binding:---

The data can be transferred from component to view but transfers specially into the directives those are structural directives.

syntax:-[ng style] = "property_name"

eg.,<h1>Property binding</h1>
   
<div><img [src]="image"></div>

3.Style/attribute binding:---

It allows binding attributes of elements from component to view.

Data flow is from c-->view

syntax:-[href]="propert-name",[img],[src]

4.custom attribute binding:---

[],{{}} used the existing property to bind the data from c--> view

it extends the properties,built in properties.

Adds the customized and additional functionality to bind the data.

syntax:-[attr.<attribute_name>]="property-name"

whenever we are binding a property to html template,that property should be availiable in respective ts file.

if we are declaring some variable/property in ts file and not using in html..

Filmlink is not a attribute but we have created custom attribute..

5.Event binding:--- 

Allows to  bind events of elements from view to component.

Data flow is one way ie.,From view to component.

Javascript events:-click,forms,hover,input,onkeydown,onkeyUp

syntax:-(click)="methodname()"

e.g.,<div>
  <button (click)="goBack()">Go back</button>
</div>

  ===========================================================================================

b)Two way data binding:-

The data flow is in both waysie., from component to view and view to component. 

It is combination of property binding and event binding. 

Binding is done using ngModel.

syntax:-

div,p,a etc., all the html templates we can add to this data binding

[(ngmodel)]

This two way data binding will be used in the forms or to read the values from html.
then we need to import FormsModule.
