Angular FrameWork:- 

Framework:-Basic structure , framework is built using programming language.

           Things like routing,core,typescript etc.,parts of framework.

AngularFramework:- It is used to build single page application (SPA) using ts,html and css.

Angular components:-
 
These are basic building block to build any application.Every angular application should have atleast one component.

To generate a new component syntax:- ng generate component {component_name}

Basic structure of application:-

header, body, footer and sidenavigation.

Angular directives:- 

Directives are classes that add basic behaviour (new behaviour or enhance existing behaviour) of the template. 

Types of directives:- 

1) component directives ------@component

2) structural directives

   Builtin directives used to manipulate DOM

DOM-->HTML is a document,Document object model

  *ngIf  Else Then
  *ngFor
  *ngSwitch


Structural directives will start with '*' astricks. 

To make conditional statements or show  the templates based on condition we use structural directives.

To make conditional If,we have to use *ngIf, else

 To create a template reference variable 
  
   <ng-template></ng-template> 

if else and then --> if can be directly written using *ngIf 
                     then and else should be written in Template variable.
**ngFor?? -- For loop 
To iterate the elements in the array and generate the dynamic template in the HTML

1.Index--index gives the current index of array elements
2.first--tells if the element is first in the array
3.last--if the element is last in the array
4.Odd--if the index is odd
5.even--if the index is even

We can switch cases -->
 [NgSwitch]
 *ngSwitchCase
 *ngSwitchDefault


3) Attribute directives --> [ngClass] [ngStyle] 

Custom Directives:- 

In order to extend the functionality of an application we go with custom directives. 

ng generate directive <name_of_directive>
